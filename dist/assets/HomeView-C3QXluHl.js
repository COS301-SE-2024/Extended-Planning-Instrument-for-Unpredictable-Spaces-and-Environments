In this landscape of untapped opportunities, our mission is clear â€“ design a system that transforms inefficiency into a symphony of precision. Imagine a logistics realm where every truck is a marvel of intelligent packing and optimal space management. This project isn&#39;t just an upgrade; it&#39;s a revolution in efficiency. </p></section><section class="background-motivation" data-v-ee326711><h2 data-v-ee326711>Background &amp; Motivation</h2><p data-v-ee326711> The motivation behind this project is rooted in the recognition of these missed opportunities within the logistics behemoth. Imagine the transformative power of a system that can seamlessly convert inefficiency into precision, elevating each logistical operation to the level of a finely tuned symphony. The goal is not merely an incremental upgrade; it&#39;s a bold revolution aimed at reshaping the very essence of efficiency within the logistics sector. </p></section><section class="system-requirements" data-v-ee326711><h2 data-v-ee326711>System Requirements</h2><h3 data-v-ee326711>Core Requirements</h3><ol data-v-ee326711><li data-v-ee326711>Design an algorithm to dynamically adjust the placement of goods in real-time, optimizing the available space within the logistics truck.</li><li data-v-ee326711>Develop a robust machine learning model that learns from historical data, user feedback, and real-world outcomes to continuously enhance the packing algorithm.</li><li data-v-ee326711>Create an interface for logistics managers to input specific constraints, preferences, and priorities for the packing algorithm.</li><li data-v-ee326711>Provide a dashboard that displays real-time information about the packing progress as well as process, essentially displaying the data of the algorithm.</li></ol><h3 data-v-ee326711>Optional Requirements</h3><ol data-v-ee326711><li data-v-ee326711>Add route-based optimization, where the truck will be packed in the order of its destinations, so unpacking of the truck will happen intuitively in the sense last-in is first-out algorithm.</li></ol><h3 data-v-ee326711>Wow Factors</h3><ol data-v-ee326711><li data-v-ee326711>Design a way to simulate the packing of the truck through the use of the algorithm/model using a renderer/simulation which would showcase the packing of the truck.</li></ol></section><section class="architecture-requirements" data-v-ee326711><h2 data-v-ee326711>Architecture Requirements</h2><h3 data-v-ee326711>Performance</h3><p data-v-ee326711>The system should return the optimal packing route within 2-5 minutes of the provided configuration/input parameters.</p><h3 data-v-ee326711>Scalability</h3><p data-v-ee326711>The system should be scalable in the sense the algorithm could potentially be used for packing cargo trains, or shipping containers.</p></section>',5),r=[s];function c(l,h,d,p,m,u){return a(),t("div",n,r)}const f=e(o,[["render",c],["__scopeId","data-v-ee326711"]]);export{f as default};
